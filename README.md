# Overview

    - Parsing content from the Yelp API using Node.
    - Using this to learn more about Node and Express.

# Information

    - Will add other functionality.
    - I will be building a front-end app, in React to use this API.
        - I am choosing React to get more practice with using function based components and leveraging JWT Tokens for protected API endpoint(s).

# TODO:

    - Adding JWT authentication.
